# Module 5: Variability

-   One important characterization of a population is *how spread out*
    it is.
-   One key measure of spread is *variance*, measured with the sample
    variance, or the *standard deviation*.
-   The standard deviation has the same units as the population
    (different from the variance).
-   The variance is itself an intrinsically interesting quantity that we
    want to estimate. Also, the variance of our estimates is what makes
    them not imprecise. An important aspect of statistics is quantifying
    the variability in the estimates (uncertainty quantification).

## The Variance

The **variance** of a random variable is a measure of spread. It
measures how fat or how thin or how spread out or how concentrated is
the distribution.

The variance of a random variable *X* with mean *Œº* is defined as the
expected value of its squared distance from the mean

Accounting for the fact that *Œº*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑùîº\[*X*\] it can be easily proven
that:

The densities with higher variances are more spread out than the
densities with lower variances.

The square root of the variance is called the **standard deviation**.

The variance is expressed in units squared, while the standard deviation
is expressed in the same units as the random variable *X*.
